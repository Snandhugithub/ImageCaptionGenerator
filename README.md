# ImageCaptionGenerator

# Description

This project implements an Image Caption Generator using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells for generating descriptive captions for images. The model is implemented in Python using popular deep learning libraries.

# Features

Utilizes a pre-trained CNN (such as VGG16 or ResNet) to extract image features.


Employs an LSTM-based RNN to generate captions based on extracted features.


Allows customization of hyperparameters to fine-tune the model's performance.


Provides an interactive user interface to generate captions for uploaded images.

The image encoder takes an image as input and produces a fixed-length vector of visual features that represent the image content. These features are then passed to the caption decoder. The caption decoder takes the visual features from the image encoder and generates a sequence of words that describe the image. The decoder is typically implemented which can learn to capture the sequential structure of language and generate coherent sentences. To generate a caption, the decoder starts with a special start token and predicts the next word in the sequence based on the visual features and the previously generated words. This process is repeated until an end token is predicted or a maximum caption length is reached. The decoder can also use attention mechanisms to focus on different parts of the image while generating the caption, which can improve the quality of the generated captions.
